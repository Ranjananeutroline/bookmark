      "First of all, every idea is valuable. It will definitely be useful to someone for a while. But there are a few parameters for more specific answers.For example, if it's solving a problem, no one is doing it, or just a few people are doing it, filling a gap, it's probably a good and valuable idea.To understand this, question your opinion. You can have a good sense at the beginning by asking questions such as who will benefit when I uncover this, will it be really useful, will it solve a problem, how many people are doing this or is anyone doing it?

      "Convincing someone to an idea can be very difficult. First, get to know the people you want to persuade and get to know a lot of people. Don't talk to a few people and say that's enough.Don't try to sell them your idea. Sell your enthusiasm so they can embrace your idea as you do. So if they feel a little bit of what you feel, then they have a better chance of being convinced of your idea. ",

    title: "Is it possible to start entrepreneurship without money?",
    description:
      "First of all, can you start the solution produced for the idea in your mind free of charge? If a product is to be produced physically, it is not very likely to start without money. Even if we don't have any money, we can save money from our spending of 6 months or 1 year on average to bring our idea to life. If we are very confident in our opinion, this past 1 year will not be so important. In this time, you can solidify your foundation by researching whether this idea is good or not.  ",
